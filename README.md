### Initially it is deployed in Render, but since it doesn't allow me to have more than two free trial databases I had to delete it. Below I attach screenshots of how it looks.
### It used REST URL Naming Convention for URL path with GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE http methods. Look at the sheet routing [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MeW2_r51WHHO92wOqDIr4oJeQmrz1-T17Wl2IMBUmqY/edit?usp=sharing).
